MOTHER of Rome, Delight of Men and Gods, Sweet Venus; who with vital power dost fill the sea bearing the ships, the fruitful Earth, all things beneath the rolling signs of Heaven; for ‘tis by Thee creatures of every kind conceive, rise into life, and view the Sun’s bright beams. Thee Goddess, Thee the winds avoid; the clouds fly Thee, and thy approach; with various art the Earth for Thee affords her sweetest flowers; for Thee the sea’s rough waves put on their smiles, and the smooth sky shines with diffused light. For when the buxom Spring leads on the year, and genial gales of western winds blow fresh, unlock’d from Winter’s cold, the airy birds first feel Thee Goddess, and express thy power; thy active flame strikes though their very souls. And then the savage beasts, with wanton play, frisk o’er the cheerful fields, and swim the rapid streams. So pleased with thy sweetness, so transported by thy soft charms, all living Nature strives, with sharp desire, to follow Thee, her Guide, where Thou art pleased to lead. In short, Thy power, inspiring every breast with tender love, drives every creature on with eager heat, in seas, in mountains, and in swiftest floods, in leafy forests, and in verdant plains, to propagate their kind from age to age.

Since Thou alone dost govern Nature’s laws, and nothing without Thee can rise to light, without Thee nothing can look gay or lovely; I beg Thee a companion to my lays, which now I sing of Nature, I devote to my dear Memmius, whom Thou art ever pleased, sweet Goddess, to adorn with every grace; for him, kind Deity, inspire my song, and give immortal beauty to my verse. Mean time, the bloody tumults of the war by sea and land compose, and lay asleep. For Thou alone mankind with quiet peace canst bless; because ‘tis Mars Armipotent that rules the bloody tumults of the war, and He by everlasting pains of love bound fast, tastes in Thy lap most sweet repose, turns back his smooth long neck, and views thy charms, and greedily sucks love at both his eyes. Supinely as he rests his very soul hangs on thy lips; this God dissolv’d in ease, in the soft moments when thy heavenly limbs cling round him, melting with eloquence caress, great Goddess, and implore a peace for Rome.

For neither can I write with cheerful strains, in times so sad, nor can the noble House of Memmius desert the common good in such distress of things.
